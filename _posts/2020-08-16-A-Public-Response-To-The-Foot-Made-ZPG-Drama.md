### About the drama: 
Earlier this year, I posted a short video to my QQ group chat server. In the video I rubbed a handheld case with my feet. This video was unpleasant to many people who watched it. I sincerely apologize for what I did. 

### 事件回顾：
今年上半年我在群里发了一小段视频，视频中我用尼龙ZPG掌机的外壳搓脚。这个视频造成了不好的影响，让喜欢ZPG掌机的爱好者感觉不适，我对此诚恳的道歉。

Recently, some people, especially DIYGameModz, re-posted this old video to Youtube and many social media sites, and condemned me for posting the video. For his criticisms, I’d like to clarify the following aspects. 

1.	The original intention of posting the video was only for fun and to amuse few familiar friends in my own QQ group chat server. Now I’ve realized that it was a stupid idea. However, I never wanted to spread the video to more people by myself. I didn't expect people to save and repost it either. 
2.	The handheld case in the video was not for ZPG pro. It was an old 3D printed nylon case for the handmade ZPG handhelds. 
3.	When the video was posted, I just finished the injection mold for ABS cases and decided to discard the 3D printing solution.
4.	Now I realize it's stupid to joke about even the discarded case. My stupid behavior doesn’t represent my attitude towards my products.
5.	The original video didn’t include any texts or  subtitles. Any video with texts or subtitles are derivative work that I’m not responsible for.

最近一段时间有人把这个视频发布到各个社交媒体，对我进行谴责，对此我想澄清的几个点：

1.	发视频的初衷是和QQ群内的少数熟悉的人开个玩笑。我现在已经意识到了这个玩笑很愚蠢，但是我没有想要去传播这个视频，没有想到视频会被人保存下来并且传播到更多地方
2.	视频中的外壳不是ZPG Pro的，是初版ZPG使用的3D打印尼龙外壳
3.	发视频的时间是ZPG的ABS外壳刚刚开模成功，尼龙外壳被弃用的时候
4.	用废弃的产品外壳开玩笑虽然很蠢，但这不能代表我对于我的产品的态度
5.	原始视频不含任何文字，包含文字的视频均为网友二次创作，与本人无关

I believe it’s unjustified and of ulterior motives for DIYGameModz to make such accusations against me for the following reasons. 
1.	DIYGameModz is not an ordinary game player. They are a vendor of other retro game handhelds. It's hard to believe that they discredit me purely for enthusiasts’ interests. 
2.	It was my bad to post the video in my own QQ group chat server in the first place. However, DIYGameModz posted the video to multiple social media sites and publicised it, which was also wrong. 
3.	There are many misleading words in his posts and comments. ZPG Pro is the product that we will release next. It has nothing to do with the case in the video. However, DIYGameModz deliberately mentioned ZPGPro multiple times in his comments, such as “zpgpro這個行為 (the behavior of ZPG pro)”, and “ZPGpro代言人(spokesman of ZPG Pro)”.
4.	Unfounded and malicious speculation about my motivation. He said “用腳打磨產品外殼，這說明你何等的不情願做這個產品 (polishing the case with your feet shows how reluctant you are to make this product)” Making a joke with a discarded case doesn’t mean that I am not happy with my work and my products. 
5.	Unfounded and malicious interpretation about my behavoir. He said, “工廠項目的參與者對產品進行侮辱性的挑釁 (the factory project participant provoked his products insultingly) ”. As I explained above, this was a stupid joke, not provocation. Why would I invoke my own products? 
6.	Malicious insinuation. He said, “ZPG pro (350h): are they all made and assembled in this way?”. Again, the case in the video was just a discarded 3D printed case. It has nothing to do with the manufacturing of either GKD or ZPG products. 

我认为DIYGameModz近期对搓脚视频的传播是对ZPG的恶意抹黑，理由如下： 
1.	DIYGameModz不是普通玩家，而是其他掌机的代理商。抹黑我的动机很难相信不是为了自身的利益，而是为了玩家的利益。
2.	我把这个视频发出去是错误的，但DIYGameModz把半年前小圈子发的视频重新发布于各个社交媒体和视频网站并且大肆宣传，同样也是错误的。
3.	DIYGameModz的文案内容有很多误导性的用词。ZPG pro是我们接下来要发布的产品，与搓脚视频无关，但是DIYGameModz一直混淆ZPG和ZPG Pro，例如“zpgpro這個行為” “ZPGpro代言人”。
4.	毫无根据的恶意揣度我的动机，“用腳打磨產品外殼，這說明你何等的不情願做這個產品” 用废弃外壳开玩笑并不能直接得出我不情愿做产品的结论
5.	毫无根据的恶意解读我的行为，“工廠項目的參與者對產品進行侮辱性的挑釁”。如我上面的解释，这只是一个很蠢的玩笑，并不是挑衅，我也没有理由要去挑衅自己的产品。
6.	恶意影射和暗示，“ZPG pro (350H): Are they all made and assembled in this way? ”。再次声明，开玩笑的视频是废弃的外壳，和生产过程无关。

I hope DIYGameModz and others can stop spreading this video and stop discrediting me. I'll learn from this mistake, stop making stupid jokes, and focus on the development and improvements of my products.

我希望DIYGameModz以及其他人马上停止传播此视频并停止对我的污蔑。我会吸取这次的教训，不再开低级趣味的玩笑，把更多精力投入到开发和提高我的产品上。
